                The beauty of life is that we decide how we want each chapter of our life to look like. A step at a time
                can change
                the overall perspective of how one view life, it can alter ones mindset and change their entire
                lifestyle. I go on a
                hike whenever I need a change in altitude. The goal is never to get to the summit at a specific time but
                to focus
                on each step I make, each deep breath I take, the soothing and satisfying exhales. The sun kissing my
                skin, exotic
                plants that scream 'pick me, take me home with you', the waterfalls that feel like they wash away all
                burdens of the world,
                not forgetting rocky trails that mirror life. Hiking helps me to be in tune with myself and to connect
                with nature.
                After all, nature teaches and heals.
